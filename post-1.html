                Consumers aware of toxic chemicals in vaping yet 91% claim they can’t quit
            </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="content">             
            <p>
                New York, NY - A recent poll of 1,000 U.S.-based consumers, consisting of those who vape and do not vape, found that nearly three-quarters of those surveyed (73 percent) see vaping as an addictive, dangerous alternative to cigarettes. Additionally, 91 percent of respondents who vape shared they have attempted to quit e-cigarettes and failed multiple times. These results suggest that e-cigarettes may be more difficult to quit than traditional cigarettes since studies with smokers report that 70-80 percent are unsuccessful in quitting.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since e-cigarettes hit the market in 2007, product type and usage have evolved, particularly among younger generations, with more than 2 million U.S. middle and high school students reporting use of e-cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Often, youth who experiment with e-cigarettes shift to also using traditional, combustible cigarettes within a short period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vaping initially presented itself as a healthier alternative for cigarette smokers and can help smokers cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke in a day. Whether e-cigarettes serve as a cessation aid in adult smokers is still being questioned by the medical and scientific community. Even if there is a consensus and e-cigarettes are found to be helpful as a cessation aid for smoking, the availability of e-cigarettes has created a new generation of young nicotine users, which is an unacceptable tradeoff. Those who use e-cigarettes are misled to believe that they are harmless and e-cigarette marketing is designed to target the youth.
            </p>

            <p>
                The new survey results show that e-cigarettes are harder to quit than combustible cigarettes, and data shows that withdrawal from e-cigarettes is as severe as traditional cigarettes. In this survey, 83 percent of respondents believe vaping is just as addictive as smoking cigarettes, while only 35 percent of vapers polled still believe vaping is “safer” than smoking cigarettes; demonstrating there is a growing awareness among e-cigarette users that vaping is not healthy and is very addictive.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is some hope though, as 58 percent of the e-cigarette users surveyed believe that in today’s technology-driven world that new cessation technology could help them wean off nicotine, and potentially quit vaping altogether.
            </p>
           
            <p>
               One company that has just received the first-ever patent for a technology that can assist in decreasing nicotine intake and vaping cessation, believes they have the answer to that hope. VapeAway, creators of the first patented filter and support system designed to reduce the harmful chemical impacts of vaping commissioned this new survey to shed light on concerns among vapers and non-vapers, including the friends and loved ones of those they believe to be dependent upon nicotine. 
            </p>

            <p>
                “In our mission to eliminate vaping dependency, we decided to survey sentiments around e-cigarettes, to see what might be precluding consumers from quitting and how their loved ones feel about their addiction,” said Ike Sutton, CEO and founder of VapeAway. “The survey results confirmed our suspicions that many consumers are aware of the detrimental impacts of vaping but feel trapped in their addiction and are seeking help.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to strong demand for a technology-based cessation product, the survey results indicate vaping is peer or community driven, meaning that vapers are influenced by the behavior of those who surround them. The survey results point to a need for community support to quit vaping, as 42 percent of respondents believe that the support of their friends, family, and even other vapers would be a helpful approach for quitting.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                "Not only does vaping impact the individual, but it impacts the loved ones who surround them. Nearly half of survey respondents who do not vape shared they have a family member or loved one who vapes,” said Sutton. “There are many people vaping, but so many more who are concerned about those close to them vaping. Through this first of its kind technology, we are hoping to raise vape-danger awareness while providing tools to help vapers curtail their habit while also filtering out a significant percentage of the harmful chemicals they continue to inhale. At the same time, we are also giving a voice and tools to non-vapers to help their loved ones in their battle with vaping."
            </p>


            <p>
                Additional takeaways from the survey include:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> For those who actively vape or “sometimes” vape, 91 percent are aware of toxic impacts of e-cigarette use.</li>
                <li>
                    73 percent of all respondents believe that $100 would be a worthwhile investment to help someone quit vaping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only 23 percent of those who vape believe they can accomplish their goal of quitting their e-cigarette use in the new year.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In early 2022, VapeAway will begin distribution of their VapeAway Filters and VapeAway System. This first-ever patented device and accompanying support system are designed to help people quit vaping while they vape. The technology reduces the harmful chemical impacts of vaping by utilizing a revolutionary filter that minimizes addiction to nicotine without administering a drug.
