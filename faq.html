                        Our VapeAway filters and VapeAway system use a proprietary blend of military grade, non-toxic fibers that freeze potentially harmful toxic chemicals on contact, protecting you and others around you from unwanted toxins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our Vapor Freeze 2.0 Technology is so advanced that as soon as you start to use the filter from the very first inhale, you’re immediately eliminating 50% of potentially harmful toxins from entering your body. You’re also eliminating 50% of all toxins you exhale and that others breathe around you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It took us over 2 years of scientific research to design and engineer this technology. We want users to have a vaping experience that looks and feels very much the same—just with half the potentially harmful toxins. We are proud to say we have reached that goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The logic and science is simple - to make vaping less detrimental to the vaper by cutting the more than 10 potentially harmful chemicals a vaper unknowingly ingests when vaping.  Our filters, which underwent more than 2 years of research and development and has been tested by experts, achieve this filtration using our patent pending Vapor Freeze 2.0 technology.

                        Similar to a water filter, the water streams and tastes the same but the filter collects impurities. VapeAway works in much the same way, you will be able to continue vaping while the patent pending VaporFreeze 2.0 technology in our filter collects 50% of the more than 10 potentially harmful chemicals.

                        All chemicals inhaled that are not commonly found in the lung can be potentially harmful. In addition to nicotine, the most common chemicals found in e-liquids are 'fatty' or lipid-based chemicals. These include glycerin and propylene glycol. The other known toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde often are carried in these lipid-based chemicals.

                        Nicotine patches literally have the nicotine chemical embedded into the patch. Once applied to an individual’s arm, nicotine is slowly released into the user’s bloodstream and travels to their brain to gradually satisfy their cravings. The recommended time to use the nicotine patch system is between eight and ten weeks, while requiring a person not to smoke or vape while using it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All nicotine patches come with many warnings on packaging because that process of releasing a dangerous foreign chemical into your body can cause severe damaging side effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VapeAway System is designed to give you the tools you need to really succeed.  It is a disposable filtration system that stops the nicotine before it enters your body by reducing the nicotine intake in levels, beginning at 25% and increasing to 75% over the course of 9 weeks, thus reprogramming your brain to decrease its cravings, and reduce dependency. The VapeAway System works with your existing vaping pen and pods, not requiring you to stop cold turkey, providing better outcomes on those whose goal is to ultimately reduce their nicotine dependency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While nicotine patches are exclusively sold to adults, VapeAway System can be used by anyone because it is not releasing any chemicals into your body, and instead, preventing them from entering and making the experience less detrimental.

                        According to an August 2021 Healthline article, while the link between traditional smoking and lung cancer are well established, we don’t yet necessarily have all the data between vaping and lung cancer.  That said, while vaping is believed to be less dangerous than smoking, it’s not without risk.  “In fact, the e-cigarette or vaping liquid contains nicotine and other chemicals that can be potentially toxic to your lungs. And based on the knowledge that exists about those chemicals, it’s possible that exposure to them via vaping might also increase a user’s risk of lung cancer.”
